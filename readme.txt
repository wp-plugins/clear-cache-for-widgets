Purges all cache on WPEngine, W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache when updating a widget.

== Description ==

W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache are great caching plugins, but they do not know when a widget is updated.  WPEngine is the best place to host your WordPress installation, but their caching system is no smarter when it comes to updating widgets.  I created this plugin because my website did not see any changes when saving widgets using these caching systems.  Clear Cache For Widgets will purge ALL your cache each time you save a widget.  It may be overkill, which may be why it's not built in, but some people need simplicity.
